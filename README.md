For additional information and consultation regarding the code, please email me, Nelson Mejia, or Mark Saba if you'd like.  
This repository contains the R scripts and Python code to analyze two gene expression microarray profiles. 
The first Dataset is titled "A Fasting-Responsive Signaling Pathway that Extends Life Span in C. elegans"  DOI: 10.1016/j.celrep.2012.12.018 NCBI GEO Accession Number GSE27677 
The second Dataset is titled "The Mediator Subunit MDT-15 Confers Metabolic Adaptation to Ingested Material" DOI: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000021 MNCBI GEO Accession Number GSE9720
Each dataset was analyzed slightly differently given the microarrays used in each study, so for each script, the process of normalization, transformation, and final processing varies, so please pay close attention to which script is being used and execute the line of code with caution. 
This repository is still under construction, so please check back for updates!
