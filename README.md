For additional information and consultation regarding code please email either myself-Nelson Mejia or Mark Saga upon request.  
This repositary contains the R scripts and python code used for the analysis of two gene expression microarray profiles. 
First dataset is titled "A Fasting-Responsive Signaling Pathway that Extends Life Span in C. elegans”  DOI: 10.1016/j.celrep.2012.12.018 NCBI GEO Accession Number GSE27677 
Second Dataset is titled “The Mediator Subunit MDT-15 Confers Metabolic Adaptation to Ingested Material” DOI: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000021 MNCBI GEO Accession Number GSE9720
each dataset was analyzed slightly different given the microarrays used in each study so for each script the process of normalization, transformation, and final processing vary so place close attention to which script is being used and execute line of code with caution 
This repository is still under construction so please check back for updates!
